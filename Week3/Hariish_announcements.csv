Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness
organic takeovers
of the front page (twice), read touching
stories
about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality
discussed on the front page
(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the
hundreds of thousands of calls
they drove to Congress.
It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this
public concern
, not to mention the
objections expressed by his fellow commissioners
,
the FCC’s own CTO
,
more than a hundred members of Congress
,
dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet
.
Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.
Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.
What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference.
This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.
u/arabscarab (Jessica, our head of policy) will also be in the comments to address your questions.

evidence
is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties (or no party at all), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help.
The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one.
“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words:
Congressional Review Act.
What is it?
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made
a video explaining the process
.
What’s happening in Congress?
Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only
#onemorevote
away from the 51 it needs to pass!
What should I do?
Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on
this scoreboard
. If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.
If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:
“My name is ________ and I live in ______. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative_______ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”
Pro tips:
-
Be polite
. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince.
-
Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU
. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up
here
.
-
If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!
Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.

Don’t give up.
The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/,132248,19869,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.
Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.
If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.
Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.
NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.",

Call your Senators
, then join us for an AMA with one.
EDIT:
Senator Markey's AMA is live now.
Hey Reddit, time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight!
When we
last checked in
on this in February, we told you about the
Congressional Review Act
, which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let’s remind them that we’re watching!
Today, you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”
in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that
Orangered
Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in
calling your Senators
(both of ‘em!) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort
here
.
We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in
r/politics
today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!
Finally, seeing
the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved
in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!
There is strength in numbers, and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big, Reddit-y hug.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her.
We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions.
On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of
r/ukpolitics
. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of
r/ukpolitics
, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the
r/ukpolitics
moderation team that we had restored the mod.
We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.
Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.
We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.
We did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.",

post on Reddit
that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.
Earlier this year Facebook discovered a
Russian campaign
on its platform, which was further analyzed by the Atlantic Council and dubbed “
Secondary Infektion
.” Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination. We were then able to use these accounts to identify additional suspect accounts that were part of the campaign on Reddit. This group provides us with important attribution for the recent posting of the leaked UK documents, as well as insights into how adversaries are adapting their tactics.
In late October, an account
u/gregoratior
posted the leaked documents and later reposted by an additional account
u/ostermaxnn
. Additionally, we were able to find a pocket of accounts participating in
vote manipulation
on the original post. All of these accounts have the same shared pattern as the original Secondary Infektion group detected, causing us to believe that this was indeed tied to the original group.
Outside of the post by
u/gregoratior
, none of these accounts or posts received much attention on the platform, and many of the posts were removed either by moderators or as part of normal content manipulation operations. The accounts posted in different regional subreddits, and in several different languages.
Karma distribution:
0 or less: 42
1 - 9: 13
10 or greater: 6
Max Karma: 48
As a result of this investigation, we are banning
1 subreddit
and 61 accounts under our policies against vote manipulation and misuse of the platform. As we have done with previous influence operations, we will also preserve these accounts for a time, so that researchers and the public can scrutinize them to see for themselves how these accounts operated.
EDIT: I'm signing off for the evening. Thanks for the comments and questions.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/,73261,7426,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,"TL;DR
: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again.
What happened?
On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA.
Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.
Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.
What information was involved?
Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:
All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses
What was accessed:
A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted
hashed
passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.
How to tell if your information was included:
We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018
What was accessed:
Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they
look like this
. The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to.
How to tell if your information was included:
If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [
noreply@redditmail.com
](mailto:
noreply@redditmail.com
) between June 3-17, 2018.
As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.
What is Reddit doing about it?
Some highlights. We:
Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password.
Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)
What can you do?
First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.
If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today.
If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this
help page
.
And, as in all things, a strong unique password and
enabling 2FA
(which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",

Today, in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content, we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!
Why Polls?
It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

a lot of rules
in our vote tallying as a way to mitigate cheating and brigading on posts and comments.
Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.
Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been
to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site
.
Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules.
Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.
To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.
TL;DR
voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot.
Edit
: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8qfw8l/protecting_the_free_and_open_internet_european/,56031,2749,Protecting the Free and Open Internet: European Edition,"Hey Reddit,
We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet, and we know Redditors do too. Specifically, we’ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now’s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will
vote on changes
to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:
Article 11
would create a ""link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit.
Article 13
would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.
The unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe.
Luckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm.
Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for
an AMA on the subject
. In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!
As a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an
easy tool
to help you identify and call your MEP.
Here are some things you’ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP’s office:
Share your name, location and occupation.
Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).
Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?
Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message—your concern will still be registered.
Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human.
Phone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!
And be sure to let us know how it went! Share stories about what your MEP told you in the comments below.
PS If you’re an American and don’t want to miss out on the fun, there is still plenty to do on our side of the pond to save the free and open internet. On June 11, the net neutrality rollback
officially went into effect
, but the effort to reverse it in Congress is still going strong in the House of Representatives.

We’re constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces, from raising money
for children’s hospitals
to shutting down the “inevitable” SOPA/PIPA. Today, European redditors, along with other concerned EU netizens, helped do the impossible once more. Thanks to the ruckus they raised with their Members of the European Parliament,
the flawed EU Copyright Directive has been sent back to the drawing board
, ending (for now) the threats to subject all user uploads to automated content filtering, and require licensing fees for all links.
There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland
noted
that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote.

) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate
r/Europe
for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with
MEP Julia Reda
and Europe’s leading
independent experts on copyright reform
, they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out
their tally of the July 5th vote
to see how your MEP voted), and they
used megathreads
to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help.
What’s Next?
This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression.
The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter
r/all
now.
Hi All,
I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.
The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.
Many of you are aware of my attempt to
troll the trolls
last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and
explained what I did
.
I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.
While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of
r/the_donald
), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate,
u/kn0thing
, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.
More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the
r/the_donald
outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.
However, when we separate the behavior of some of
r/the_donald
users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our
Content Policy
asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.
Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:
We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on
r/the_donald
will no longer appear in
r/all
.
r/all
is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which
r/the_donald
does to slingshot posts into
r/all
, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.
We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.
Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.
Steve

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40926,40659,"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here","TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.
u/kn0thing
has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.
After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.
Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”
These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy.
Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.
However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:
Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement.
Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism.
Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.
We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current
content policy
is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.
We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.
And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (
u/kn0thing
), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.
At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.
In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we
banned racist users
anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.”
I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy
ossified
and its content policy took
no position on hate
.
When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like
r/CoonTown
, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not.
We banned that community and others
because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our
2015 policy
around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies
2017
,
2018
,
2019
,
2020
(and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities.
While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said
racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit
. This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.
This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with
r/the_donald
, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.
The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a
community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online
. That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this.
Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.
I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.
Thanks,
Steve",

Transparency Report
. I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.
Hi all,
It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.
We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.
You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.
By the numbers
Since the
full report
is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:
ADMIN REMOVALS
In 2019, we removed
~53M
pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
For
Content Policy
violations, we removed
222k
pieces of content
,
55.9k accounts
, and
21.9k
subreddits
(
87%
of which were removed for being unmoderated).
Additionally, we quarantined
256 subreddits
.
LEGAL REMOVALS
Reddit received
110 requests
from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with
37.3%
.
In 2019 we removed about
5x more
content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.
REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION
We received a total of
772 requests
for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
366
of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (
68%
of which we complied with).
406
were non-emergency requests (
73%
of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
Reddit received an additional
224 requests
to temporarily preserve certain user account information (
86%
of which we complied with).
Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our
Privacy Policy
and
Guidelines for Law Enforcement
.)
While I have your attention...
I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.
When we
expanded our quarantine policy
, we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.
Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.
If you’ve read this far
In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in

It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.
Where do I vote?
Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office (
find yours here
). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.
There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area.
The Voting Information Tool
is one of the easiest to use.
Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?
It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so
you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered
. You can
check your state’s registration requirements here
. In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.
What do I need to bring with me?
Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are
here
.
If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.
Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!
What am I going to be voting on?
Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can
look up a sample ballot for your area
to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.
I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?
Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can
learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.
Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?
Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials (
look up their contact info here
).
If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),
report it to the admins here
.
I have more questions about voting!
DoSomething.org is back doing a
marathon AMA today
with their experts in

We have been
slowly rolling this feature out
, starting with beta testers, moderators, and third-party app developers, to ensure a positive experience across devices. Your feedback has been incredibly valuable, from pointing out bugs to recommending features. Thank you to everyone involved in testing.
Two-factor adds more security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. In this case, if you opt into 2FA, you’ll access a 6-digit verification code generated by your phone after a new sign-in attempt.
With two-factor enabled, even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you.
You can enable two-factor by selecting the
password/email
tab under your preferences on desktop. Select
enable
under
two-factor authentication
and follow the steps given to you. And make sure to generate your backup codes in the event your phone is unavailable! You can find more help in our
Help Center
.
Two-factor is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party apps. It requires an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or any app supporting the TOTP protocol) to generate your 6-digit verification code.
A few handy security reminders:
Choose a strong and unique password. We recommend at least 8 characters. And don’t reuse the same password on Reddit as other sites!
Add a verified email address. Email is the only way for us to reset your account. (We do require a verified email for setting up two-factor authentication since the account can be lost if, for example, you lose your phone).

Are You Registered?,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address.
Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with
Nonprofit VOTE
to celebrate
National Voter Registration Day
and help spread the word before the midterms this November.
You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments.
We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments.

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:
Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x…) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released
AMP site
and moderator mail are already running on 2X.
Speaking of modmail, the beta we
announced
a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you,
r/DIY
!). The community
feedback
has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.
Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our
privacy policy
and have added a permanent link to this
opt-out page
. The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics’. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.
We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved
spoiler tags
went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.
We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.
Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to
create an account
. It will be a fantastic event this year.
I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

Hey Everyone!
(And a very special
bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,
and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)
It’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet.
When we last left you
on July 5 (aka
Meme Day
), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install
error-prone copyright filters
on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.
The July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments,
MEP Julia Reda
has a
pretty good rundown of them here
(note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily).
The bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi
break down why that is here
).
The good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in
A©tion Week
to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at
SaveYourInternet.eu
have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them.
Check it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/,31117,21707,"In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I’d like to share our thinking.","In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it’s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.
Given the recent news, we’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:
When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.
On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don’t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our
ad policies
prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.
As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015–2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.
The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN_GOP’s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.
I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It’s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues. It’s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we’re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.
Thank you for reading. While I know it’s frustrating that we don’t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.",

Reddit-hosted video and gifs
;
crossposting

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps
should
make moderators happy (but you never know how these things will go…).
Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

We just posted our
2016 Transparency Report
. It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions
here
.
Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit’s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.
Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.
Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in
amicus briefs
. Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.
We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on
behalf of Facebook
in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook’s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.
Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (“Knight”) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici
filed a response
in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court’s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230’s immunity.
Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.
I’ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can’t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Back in the day, the original version of the front page looked an awful lot like
r/all
.  In fact, it
was
r/all
.  But, when we first released the ability for users to
create subreddits
, those new, nascent communities had trouble competing with the larger, more established subreddits which dominated the top of the front page.  To mitigate this effect, we created the notion of the defaults, in which we
cherry picked
a set of subreddits to appear as a default set, which had the effect of editorializing Reddit.
Over the years, Reddit has grown up, with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities, each with enormous reach and great content. Consequently, the “defaults” have received a disproportionate amount of traffic, and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit. We, therefore, are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching
r/popular
, which, like
r/all
, opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page.
Logged out users will land on “popular” by default and see a large source of diverse content.
Existing logged in users will still maintain their subscriptions.
How are posts eligible to show up “popular”?
First, a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place. 
Post from the following types of communities will not show up on “popular”:
NSFW and 18+ communities
Communities that have opted out of
r/all
A handful of subreddits that users
consistently filter
out of their
r/all
page
What will this change for logged in users?
Nothing! Your frontpage is still made up of your subscriptions, and you can still access
r/all
. If you sign up today, you will still see the 50 defaults. We are working on making that transition experience smoother. If you are interested in checking out
r/popular
, you can do so by clicking on the link on the gray nav bar the top of your page, right between “FRONT” and “ALL”.
TL;DR:
We’ve created a new page called “popular” that will be the default experience for logged out users, to provide those users with better, more diverse content.

TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.
Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.
Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched
r/popular
as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results.
New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick
tutorial page
on how to subscribe to communities.
On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding
in-line subscription buttons

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4y0m56/why_reddit_was_down_on_aug_11/,26374,3266,Why Reddit was down on Aug 11,"tl;dr
On Thursday, August 11, Reddit was down and unreachable across all platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.
Thank you all for contributions to
r/downtimebananas
.
Impact
On Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system.
No data was lost.
Cause and Remedy
We use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load.
Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.
At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to “down mode” while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally.
Prevention
As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations.
Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations.
Properly disable package management systems during migrations so they don’t affect systems unexpectedly.
Last Thoughts
We take downtime seriously, and are sorry for any inconvenience that we caused. The silver lining is that in the process of restoring our systems, we completed a big milestone in our operations modernization that will help make development a lot faster and easier at Reddit.",

Reddit is a great place to discuss the things you love.  And right now the culture industry is working overtime to pump out oodles of the things you love.  Whatever these passions, you can find a community on Reddit that is as excited about them as you are.  That could be:

OP can now mark their post as a spoiler — this will add a tag to the post that clearly identifies it containing spoilers and pixilate the preview image if there is one.  Other users can then decide whether or not they want to view the post.

Today we’ve posted our latest
Transparency Report
.
The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.
We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.
This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the
purpose, tone, and norms of their community
. You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.
In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.
I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

On Reddit we call these points Karma.  You get Karma when content you post to Reddit receives upvotes.  Your Karma is displayed on

You may also know that you can submit different types of posts to Reddit.  One of these post types is a text-post (e.g. this thing you’re reading right now is a text-post).  Due to
various shenanigans and low effort content
we stopped giving Karma for text-posts over 8 years ago.
However, over time the usage of text-posts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit.  Who could forget such classics as:

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,21319,38345,Update to Our Content Policy,"A few weeks ago
, we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).
First, a quick recap
Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:
We brought on a
new Board member
.
We held policy calls with mods
—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
You can find
detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here
, including specific product work we discussed.
We developed our enforcement plan
, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).
From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level,
scaling enforcement efforts
, measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment
year over year
—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.
These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.
Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.
New Policy
This is the
new content policy
. Here’s what’s different:
It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
Rule 1
explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our
Help Center article
.
Rule 2
ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.
Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about
200
have more than 10 daily users. Both
r/The_Donald
and
r/ChapoTrapHouse
were included.
All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned
r/The_Donald
because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.
Though smaller,
r/ChapoTrapHouse
was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.
To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.
Our commitment
Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.
But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:
First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your
stories
and passion about this issue. Thank you again for
making your voice heard
.
We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.
Reddit has
closed another round of funding
. This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.
On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more
geo-specific
views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.
We’re making some changes to our
Privacy Policy
. Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own
privacy controls
. DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.
Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated
community traffic
numbers to be more accurate).
While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/,21005,5011,An update on the FireEye report and Reddit,"Last week, FireEye
made an announcement
regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.
To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.
This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.
None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.
More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).
Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:
3% (4) had negative karma
33% (47) had 0 karma
24% (35) had 1-999 karma
15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma
25% (36) had 10,000+ karma
To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:
u/emilyward2017
u/Homaeefar
u/alessia_80s
u/Anzfp
u/jeremybernard
u/suarezanton
Unlike our
last post on foreign interference
, the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.
Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.
We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we’ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4oedco/lets_all_have_a_town_hall_about_rall/,20690,10652,Let’s all have a town hall about r/all,"Hi All,
A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.
Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to
r/all
. The
r/all
listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways,
r/all
is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.
The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of
r/all
—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in
r/all
.
Many people will ask if this is related to
r/the_donald
. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like
r/the_donald
over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it.
Interestingly enough,
r/the_donald
was already getting downvoted out of
r/all
yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically,
r/EnoughTrumpSpam
was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all
writing the date correctly
, I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.
In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:
We recently gave our
iOS
and
Android
apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out!
We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post-to-profile to chat (now in beta for individuals and groups), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.
Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time (profile pages, anybody?), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to
r/announcements
(major announcements),
r/beta
(long-running tests),
r/modnews
(moderator features), and
r/changelog
(most everything else).
I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.
The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for (I’m serious!). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an
artistic masterpiece
and that other time you all organized
site-wide grassroots campaigns
for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.
In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon-ish in
r/blog
.
It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. (Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from
r/beta
. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.
We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.
Happy New Year,
Steve and the Reddit team

Hi everyone!
I’m Alex–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.
Who are you?
I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with
u/mart2d2
and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job.
In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to
r/daddit
), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).
What’s New?
When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:
Deliver our first official Android Reddit App.
Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.
Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.
Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone
So here it is: introducing
Reddit for iPhone
and
Reddit for Android
, featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.
What’s Next
This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.
Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).
I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!
Thanks!
Alex
Noon PT Edit:
Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team – we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

Across the platform, existing communities like
r/science
,
r/askscience
, and
r/worldnews
have joined newly established communities like
r/Coronavirus
and
r/COVID19
to share authoritative content and welcome important discussion every day.
At Reddit Inc., we’ve also been
working
to curate expert discussions and surface the most reliable information for you. And today, we’re excited to launch the Solidarity Award, which seeks to raise funds for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic via the
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
for the
World Health Organization (WHO)
. The fund -- which is powered by the
United Nations Foundation
and the
Swiss Philanthropy Foundation
-- supports
WHO’s
work to track and understand the spread of COVID-19, ensure patients get the care they need, frontline workers get essential supplies and information, and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments for the pandemic.
Starting today, you can purchase the Solidarity Award directly on Reddit desktop and mobile web (via PayPal or Stripe), and
100% of the proceeds
will benefit the
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
for WHO.*
Here are a few details on the Solidarity Award
:
How to find the Award: The Solidarity Award can only be given on Reddit desktop and mobile web (not currently available to give on Mobile apps). You'll find the award towards the bottom of the Medals section in our Award dialog.
The full price of the Award ($3.99) will be donated by Reddit to the United Nation Foundation’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the
World Health Organization
. More information on the fund is available at

Solidarity Award
Why are we doing this?
We’ve never felt more urgency or responsibility to fulfill our mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone in the world. The Solidarity Award is meant to complement the efforts of our users, moderators, and employees at Reddit by enabling community-wide charitable giving during a time of great need.
A Heads Up:
The team at Reddit worked quickly to enable the Solidarity Award. As with all new things at this scale, we are keeping an eye out for any bugs and issues that may arise, and will update the experience accordingly.
From Reddit to all of our users:
Stay safe, be vigilant, and take care of one another.

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.
First, here is our
2017 Transparency Report
. This details government and law-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however,
decreased slightly for both types of requests
. (You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years
here
.)
We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court (Montagna), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules (County of Santa Clara v. FCC) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit (Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP).
I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the
investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit
. I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:
In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site:
70% (662) had zero karma
1% (8) had negative karma
22% (203) had 1-999 karma
6% (58) had 1,000-9,999 karma
1% (13) had a karma score of 10,000+
Of the 282 accounts with non-zero karma, more than half (145) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.
And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation.
To give you more insight into our findings,
here is a link to all 944 accounts
. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.
We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti-Evil teams are working. It’s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.
We know the success of Reddit is dependent on
your trust
. We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I’ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

why we’re redesigning Reddit on desktop
and
how moderation and community styling will work in it
. Today, I’m here as a hu
man sacrifice m
ember of Reddit’s Design team (surprise: designers actually work at Reddit!) to talk about how we’ve approached the desktop redesign and what we’ve learned from your feedback along the way.
When approaching the redesign, we all learned early on that this wasn’t just about making Reddit more usable, accessible, and efficient; it was also about learning how to interact, adapt, and communicate with the world’s largest, most passionate and genuine community of users.
Better every (feedback) loop
Every team working on this project has its share of longtime redditors—whether it's Product, Design, Engineering, or Community. To say that this has been the most challenging (and rewarding) project of our careers is an understatement. Over the past year we’ve been running surveys internally and externally. We’ve conducted video conferences with first-time users, redditors on their 10th Cake Day, moderators, and lurkers. Not to mention an extremely helpful community of alpha testers. You all have shaped the way we do every part of our jobs, from brainstorming and creating designs to building features and collecting feedback.
Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality, you came in and told us where we were wrong and, in most cases, explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you—like

What? Reddit is evolving!
Reddit is not a one-size-fits-all experience. It’s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:
Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit
Give communities tools
that are simple, intuitive, and flexible—for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.
Make our desktop experience more welcoming
Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice (e.g., different viewing options:
Card
/
Classic
/
Compact
) and familiarity to all users.
Design a foundation for the future
Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.
Keep content at the forefront
We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.
Asking Reddit
As we moved from setting high-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It’s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:
Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a “hamburger menu” on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and
filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters
.
Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts (aka “Create a post”) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you’re creating.
Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We’ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved (e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic), and we’re working on shipping fixes.
The list of user-inspired changes goes on and on (and we’re expecting a lot more
i
teration as we expand our testing pool), but this is how we’ve worked through design challenges so far.
It’s
never over
The redesign isn’t finished at “GA” (General Availability, or as I like to call it, “Time to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work”). With this post, we wanted to share some context on our approach, thank everyone who's participated in
r/redesign
so far (THANK YOU!), and let you know we will continue to engage with you on a daily basis to understand how you’re responding to what we’re building.
Over the next several weeks, we'll be expanding the number of users who have access to the alpha (yes, you will be able to opt out if you prefer the current desktop look), hearing what you think, and updating all of you as we make more changes. In the meantime, I'll be sticking around in the comments for a bit to answer questions and

shadowbans
for the vast majority of real humans and increase transparency when handling users who violate
Reddit’s content policy
.
How it works
Suspensions can only be applied to accounts by the Reddit admins (not moderators).
Suspended accounts will always receive a notification about the suspension including reason and the duration:
See example notification PM
- Sent to user account from
r/reddit.com
See example on-page notification
- Shown on pages while an account is suspended
Suspended users can reply to the notification PM to appeal their suspension
Suspensions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of infraction and the user’s previous infractions.
What it does to an account
Suspended users effectively have their account put into read-only mode.  The primary actions they will not be able to perform are:
Voting
Submitting posts
Commenting
Sending private messages
Moderators who have been suspended will not be able to perform any mod actions or access modmail while the suspension is in effect.
You can see
the full list of forbidden actions for suspended users here
.
Users in both temporary and permanent suspensions will always be able to delete/edit their posts and comments as usual.
Users browsing on a desktop version of the site will see a
pop-up notice
or
notification page
anytime they try and perform an action they are forbidden from doing.  App users will receive an error depending on how each app developer chooses to indicate the status of suspended accounts.
User pages
Visiting the user page of an account that has been permanently suspended will
indicate that the account has been suspended
and will not display any other data.
Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended.
In addition to this, we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly
display that the account in question was deleted by the user
.
Why this is a good thing
Our current form of account restriction,
the shadowban
, is great for dealing with bots/spam rings but woefully inadequate for real human beings.  We think suspensions are a vast improvement.
Suspensions inform people when they’ve broken the rules.  While this seems like a no-brainer, this helps so we can identify the specific behavior that caused the suspension.
Users are given a chance to correct their behavior.  We’re all human and we all make mistakes.  Reddit believes in the goodness of people.  We think most people won’t intentionally continue to violate a rule after being notified.
Suspensions can vary in length depending on the severity of the infraction and user’s history.  This allows flexibility when applying suspensions. Different types of infraction can have different responses.
Increased transparency.  We want to be upfront about suspending user accounts to both the user being suspended and other users (where appropriate).

Hey everyone,
We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our
Content Policy
regarding content that
threatens, harasses, or bullies
, which you can read in full
here
.
Why are we doing this?
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.
The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform.
We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.
How will these changes work in practice?
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee.
You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin.
As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our
response times have improved significantly since the start of the year
, but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.
What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing > “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too;
report it to us here
.
Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,17318,2,Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),"In case you missed
the
billboards
,
blog posts
, and
AMAs
, we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our
Up the Vote campaign
and
ongoing security and safety work
to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process:
political ads
.
First, some background
Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on
a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit
: no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads (
r/RedditPoliticalAds
), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.
Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.
The problem we’re addressing
As I mentioned
a couple months back
, unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.
If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.
The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in
r/announcements
: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that
r/announcements
isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.
Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither
r/announcements
nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.
What we’re testing today
Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the
r/announcements
post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.
Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.
A few other details to note for this test:
The discussion posts are like any other post
, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.
(If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with
opt-out instructions
.)
Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other
, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.
Communities that have already opted not to appear in
r/all
won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.
This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.
How we’re answering questions
r/announcements
posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in
r/ModNews
,
r/changelog
,
r/ModSupport
, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).
For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to
r/ModNews
and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.
Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of
r/announcements
so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from
our post
last week).
Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.
Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.
Steve
​
Edit (9/28/20):
Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward.
As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions
here
), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.
We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for
r/announcements
posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our

Hello again!
It’s been a minute since
my last post here
, so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates,
meme safety reports
, and waiting for
r/livecounting
to reach 10,000,000
to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.
We started off the quarter with a
win for net neutrality
, but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with
Europe passing a new copyright directive
that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).
We also had a lot of fun fighting for the
not-so-free
but perfectly balanced world of
r/thanosdidnothingwrong
. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get
Snoo tattoos
.
Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and
quarantined
several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to
report directly to this team
.
On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our
iOS
and
Android
apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for
OC (Original Content)
and a
Save Drafts feature
(with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign.
Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April.
Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements,
better traffic pages for
mods
, accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to
have community styling show up on mobile as well
, which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it (
I have too
). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to
give it a spin
.
Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have
a bit of fun
, and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new
Mod Help Center
and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.
Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

Edit (2020/03/30): We released a feature where you will get a push notification when you get a new follower. If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The follower list is still delayed until later this year.
Hi everyone,
We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.
We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.
We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.
If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!
Thanks!

live
Hi Mods,
As we all know, Reddit provides a home for an infinite number of people and communities. From awws and memes, to politics, fantasy leagues, and book clubs, people have created communities for just about everything. There are also entire communities dedicated solely to finding someone to talk to like
r/KindVoice
and
r/CasualConversation
. But it’s not all funny memes and gaming—as an anonymous platform, Reddit is also a space for people to express the most vulnerable parts of themselves.
People on Reddit find help in support communities that address a broad range of challenges from quitting smoking or drinking, struggling to get pregnant, or addressing abuse, anxiety, depression, or thoughts of suicide. Even communities that don’t directly relate to serious topics can get deep into serious issues, and the person you turn to in a time of need may be someone you bonded with over a game, a shared sense of humor, or the same taste in music.
When you see a post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming. Especially if you’re a moderator in that community, and feel a sense of responsibility for both the people in your community and making sure it's the type of place you want it to be.
Here at Reddit, we’ve been working on finding a thoughtful approach to self-harm and suicide response that does a few key things:
Connects people considering suicide or serious self-harm with with trusted resources and real-time support that can help them as soon as possible.
Takes the pressure of responding to people considering suicide or serious self-harm off of moderators and redditors.
Continues to uphold our high standards for protecting and respecting user privacy and anonymity.
To help us with that new approach, today we’re announcing a partnership with
Crisis Text Line
to provide redditors who may be considering serious self-harm or suicide with free, confidential, 24/7 support from trained Crisis Counselors.
Crisis Text Line is a free, confidential, text-based support line for people in the U.S. who may be struggling with any type of mental health crisis. Their Crisis Counselors are trained to put people at ease and help them make a plan to stay safe. If you’d like to learn more about Crisis Text Line, they have a helpful
summary video of their work
on their website and the complete story of how they were founded was covered in-depth in the
New Yorker article,
R U There?
How It Will Work
Moving forward, when you’re worried about someone in your community, or anywhere on Reddit, you can let us know in two ways:
Report the specific post or comment that worried you and select,
Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm.
Visit the person’s profile and select,
Get them help and support.
(If you’re using Reddit on the web, click
More Options
first.)
We’ll reach out to tell the person a fellow redditor is worried about them and put them in touch with Crisis Text Line’s trained Crisis Counselors. Don’t worry, we’ll have some rate-limiting behind the scenes so people in crisis won’t get multiple messages in short succession, regardless of the amount of requests we receive. And because responding to someone who is considering suicide or serious self-harm can bring up hard emotions or may be triggering, Crisis Text Line is also available to people who are reporting someone. This new flow will be launching next week.
Here’s what it will look like:

u/jkohhey

a lot
of
recent password dumps
made available on the parts of the internet most of us generally avoid.  With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.
Though Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are
reusing passwords between sites
.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:
Choose a
strong,
unique
password
.  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean ""use that really good password you use on sites you care about.""  I mean
""one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!""
Password reuse is really bad!
We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that
other
site you use the same password on who decides not to use
bcrypt
but rather a
nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!
Set and verify an email address
.  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.
Check your own account activity page!
If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to
change your password
.  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.
On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in
for several years
.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password ""hunter2"". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!
Q
:
But how do I make a unique password?
A
: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like
LastPass
and
1Password
because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known
heuristics
.  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]
Q
:
What's with the fear mongering??
A
:
It's been a rough month.
Also,
don't just take it from me this is important.
Q
:
Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?
A
: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if
we
get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.
Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a
huge
ecosystem
of
apps
, including our newly released
iOS
and
android
clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  ""Adding 2FA to the login flow"" will require a lot of coordination.
Q
:
Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!
A
: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know
who the enemy is
and
why!
Q
:
Do you realize you linked to

ask about
or
change their views on a wide range of topics
, share
personal, intimate feelings
, or
post cat
pictures
. This leads to great communities and deep meaningful discussions.  But, sometimes this very openness can lead to less awesome stuff like spam, trolling, and worse, harassment.  We work hard to deal with these when they occur publicly.  Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve just released a feature to help you filter them from within your own inbox: user blocking.
Believe it or not, we’ve actually had a
""block user"" feature
in a basic form for
quite a while
, though over time its utility focused to apply to only private messages.
We’ve recently updated
its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the “Block User” button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.  You will no longer be alerted if they message you further.  As before, the block is
completely silent to the blocked user
.  Blocks can be viewed or removed on
your preferences page here
.
Our changes to user blocking are intended to let you decide what your boundaries are, and to give you the option to
choose
what you want—or don’t want—to be exposed to. [And, of course, you can and should still always
report
harassment to our community team!]
These are just our first steps toward improving the experience of using Reddit, and we’re looking forward to announcing many more.",

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.
2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.
Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both
iOS
and
Android
. It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago—especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven’t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.
Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version
moderator mail
and our
mobile website
. We added
image hosting
on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.
We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our
blocking tool
, which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of
Spezgiving
, we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.
As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a
lot
of
money
; stepped up to help
grieving
families
; and even helped
diagnose
a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.
We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and
moderation tools on mobile
(native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.
One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods,

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/,14395,8612,Time to talk,"Alright folks,
this discussion
has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.
I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.
Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.
With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.
A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.
When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.
That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.
The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to
/r/all
(we didn't want
/r/all
to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.
In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break
/r/thefappening
a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways.
Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.
This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we
try
to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.
As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts.
Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.
That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet,
please do so
.
So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned
/r/thefappening
and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?
The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the
site rules
, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.
Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find
some
of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.
Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!
A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.
Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!
A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any
rules
which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the
blog post
speaks very well to this.
We have banned
/r/TheFappening
and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.
Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!
A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.
Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?
A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.
Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!
A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).
That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/,14097,20952,Let's talk content. AMA.,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”
As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing.
So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.
One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.
As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year,
Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography
. This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.
Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.
These types of content are prohibited [1]:
Spam
Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
Anything that
harasses, bullies, or abuses
an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
Sexually suggestive content featuring minors
There are other types of content that are specifically classified:
Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.
We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well.
No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.
[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.
[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""
edit: added an example to clarify our concept of ""harm""
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8m2yr4/were_updating_our_user_agreement_and_privacy/,14008,1819,"We’re updating our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (effective June 8, 2018!)","Hi all,
Today we’re posting updates to our
User Agreement
and
Privacy Policy
that will become effective June 8, 2018.  For those of you that don’t know me, I’m one of the original engineers of Reddit,
left
and then returned in 2016 (as was the style of the time), and am currently CTO.  As a
very, very early redditor
, I know the importance of these issues to the community, so I’ve been working with our Legal team on ensuring that we think about privacy and security in a technical way and continue to make progress (and are
transparent
with all of you) in how we think about these issues.
To summarize the changes and help explain the “why now?”:
Updated for changes to our services.
It’s
been a long time
since
our last significant User Agreement update
.  In general, *these* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we’re replacing are no longer available (RIP redditmade and reddit.tv), we’ve created a more
robust API process
, and we’ve launched
some
new
features
!
European data protection law.
Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as “Updates to our Privacy Policy” and “Reminder: Important update to our Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.”  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you’ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.
Clarity.
While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise (like the Copyright, DMCA & Takedown section in the User Agreement), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy (e.g., “don’t mess with Reddit” in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on “Breaking Reddit” in the content policy).
Our work won’t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I’ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we’ve built a
dedicated anti-evil team
to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we’re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we’re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.  We appreciate the work you all have done to
responsibly report security vulnerabilities
as you find them.
Note
: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.
I know it can be
difficult to stay on top of
all of these Terms of Service updates
(and what they mean for you)
, so we’ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.  I’m not a lawyer (though I can sense their presence for the sake of this thread...) so just remember we can’t give legal advice or interpretations.
Edit:
Stepping away for a bit, though I'll be checking in over the course of the day.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit/,13989,2545,A short-ish history of new features on Reddit,"Hi all,
Over the past few months, we’ve talked a lot about our desktop redesign—
why we’re doing it
,
moderation/styling tools we’re adding
, and, most recently,
how you all have shaped our designs
. Today, we’re going to try something a little different. We’d like to take all of you on a field trip,
to the Museum of Reddit
!
When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past (on Reddit
and other sites
). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.
Trippin’ Through Time
When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny’s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit’s front page
looked like this
.
In the site’s early days,
u/spez
and
u/kn0thing
played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests
by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks
, and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot
Snoo
.
As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. (Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...)
They launched commenting. (The first comment, fittingly, was about how
comments are going to ruin Reddit
.) They recoded the entire site
from Lisp to Python
. They added
limits on the lengths of post titles
. And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit’s biggest change to date:
user-created subreddits
.
It’s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it
wasn’t without controversy
. In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and
argued
passionately
against
subreddits
. (Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched
our first desktop redesign
, which received its share of
good
,
bad
, and
constructive
reviews.)
During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a
cumbersome URL trick
people used to make multireddits into
a supported feature
.
That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we’ve built in the years since then, like
image hosting
(my first project as an admin),
video hosting
,
mobile apps
,
mobile mod tools
,
flair
,
live threads
,
spoiler tags
, and
crossposting
, to name a few.
What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!
Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:
You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.
The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.
With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like
set post requirements
and
take bulk actions
more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback (more on that in our next blog post about engineering!).
Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts
One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!
Like anything we’ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we’re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.
In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. (Thank you to everyone who’s given feedback so far!) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think. And if you’d like to be part of our next group of testers, subscribe to

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pg006s/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/,13946,1,COVID denialism and policy clarifications,"“Happy” Wednesday everyone
As
u/spez
mentioned in his
announcement post
last week, COVID has been hard on all of us. It will likely go down as one of the most defining periods of our generation. Many of us have lost loved ones to the virus. It has caused confusion, fear, frustration, and served to further divide us. It is my job to oversee the enforcement of our policies on the platform. I’ve never professed to be perfect at this. Our policies, and how we enforce them, evolve with time. We base these evolutions on two things: user trends and data. Last year, after we rolled out
the largest policy change in Reddit’s history
, I shared a
post
on the prevalence of hateful content on the platform. Today, many of our users are telling us that they are confused and even frustrated with our handling of COVID denial content on the platform, so it seemed like the right time for us to share some data around the topic.
Analysis of Covid Denial
We sought to answer the following questions:
How often is this content submitted?
What is the community reception?
Where are the concentration centers for this content?
Below is a chart of all of the COVID-related content that has been posted on the platform since January 1, 2020. We are using common keywords and known COVID focused communities to measure this. The volume has been relatively flat since mid last year, but since July (coinciding with the increased prevalence of the Delta variant), we have seen a sizable increase.
COVID Content Submissions
The trend is even more notable when we look at COVID-related content reported to us by users. Since August, we see approximately 2.5k reports/day vs an average of around 500 reports/day a year ago. This is approximately 2.5% of all COVID related content.
Reports on COVID Content
While this data alone does not tell us that COVID denial content on the platform is increasing, it is certainly an indicator. To help make this story more clear, we looked into potential networks of denial communities. There are some well known subreddits dedicated to discussing and challenging the policy response to COVID, and we used this as a basis to identify other similar subreddits. I’ll refer to these as “high signal subs.”
Last year, we saw that less than 1% of COVID content came from these high signal subs, today we see that it's over 3%. COVID content in these communities is around 3x more likely to be reported than in other communities (this is fairly consistent over the last year). Together with information above we can infer that there has been an increase in COVID denial content on the platform, and that increase has been more pronounced since July. While the increase is suboptimal, it is noteworthy that the large majority of the content is outside of these COVID denial subreddits. It’s also hard to put an exact number on the increase or the overall volume.
An important part of our moderation structure is the community members themselves. How are users responding to COVID-related posts? How much visibility do they have? Is there a difference in the response in these high signal subs than the rest of Reddit?
High Signal Subs
Content positively received - 48% on posts, 43% on comments
Median exposure - 119 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
Median vote count - 21 on posts, 5 on comments
All Other Subs
Content positively received - 27% on posts, 41% on comments
Median exposure - 24 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
Median vote count - 10 on posts, 6 on comments
This tells us that in these high signal subs, there is generally less of the critical feedback mechanism than we would expect to see in other non-denial based subreddits, which leads to content in these communities being more visible than the typical COVID post in other subreddits.
Interference Analysis
In addition to this, we have also been investigating the claims around targeted interference by some of these subreddits. While we want to be a place where people can explore unpopular views, it is never acceptable to interfere with other communities. Claims of “brigading” are common and often hard to quantify. However, in this case, we found very clear signals indicating that
r/NoNewNormal
was the source of around 80 brigades in the last 30 days (largely directed at communities with more mainstream views on COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions). This behavior continued even after a warning was issued from our team to the Mods.
r/NoNewNormal
is the only subreddit in our list of high signal subs where we have identified this behavior and it is one of the largest sources of community interference we surfaced as part of this work (we will be investigating a few other unrelated subreddits as well).
Analysis into Action
We are taking several actions:
Ban
r/NoNewNormal
immediately for breaking our rules against brigading
Quarantine 54 additional COVID denial subreddits under
Rule 1
Build a new reporting feature for moderators to allow them to better provide us signal when they see community interference. It will take us a few days to get this built, and we will subsequently evaluate the usefulness of this feature.
Clarifying our Policies
We also hear the feedback that our policies are not clear around our handling of health misinformation. To address this, we wanted to provide a summary of our current approach to misinformation/disinformation in our
Content Policy
.
Our approach is broken out into (1) how we deal with health misinformation (falsifiable health related information that is disseminated regardless of intent), (2) health disinformation (falsifiable health information that is disseminated with an intent to mislead), (3) problematic subreddits that pose misinformation risks, and (4) problematic users who invade other subreddits to “debate” topics unrelated to the wants/needs of that community.
Health Misinformation. We have long interpreted our rule against posting content that “encourages” physical harm, in this
help center article
, as covering health misinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader. For example, a post pushing a verifiably false “cure” for cancer that would actually result in harm to people would violate our policies.
Health Disinformation. Our rule against impersonation, as described in this
help center article
, extends to “manipulated content presented to mislead.” We have interpreted this rule as covering health disinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead. This includes falsified medical data and faked WHO/CDC advice.
Problematic subreddits.  We have long applied
quarantine
to communities that warrant additional scrutiny. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed or viewed without appropriate context.
Community Interference. Also relevant to the discussion of the activities of problematic subreddits,
Rule 2
forbids users or communities from “cheating” or engaging in “content manipulation” or otherwise interfering with or disrupting Reddit communities.  We have interpreted this rule as forbidding communities from manipulating the platform, creating inauthentic conversations, and picking fights with other communities. We typically enforce Rule 2 through our anti-brigading efforts, although it is still an example of bad behavior that has led to bans of a variety of subreddits.
As I mentioned at the start, we never claim to be perfect at these things but our goal is to constantly evolve. These prevalence studies are helpful for evolving our thinking. We also need to evolve how we communicate our policy and enforcement decisions. As always, I will stick around to answer your questions and will also be joined by

Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been
announced below in the stickied comment
! Thanks to all who participated!
Hi all,
You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are
Community Awards
! We started testing these in a
small alpha group back in April
and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.
As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.
What Are Community Awards?
Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.
Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).
A highly decorated post on r/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!
In the above screenshot from
r/DunderMifflin
, you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are
Community Awards
.
What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?
Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the
Community Bank
.
With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the
r/IAmA
community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user,
r/IAmA
automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.
Mods can access the Community Bank to give…
Mod-Exclusive Awards
Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.
Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.
Mod-Award costing
1,800 Coins
=
1 month

Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?
Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.
Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?
Check out
our companion post on r/modnews
for all the details on how mods can create Awards!
We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but
please do note these important considerations
when creating Awards:
They must comply with
Reddit’s Content Policy
;
They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
They must be SFW.
A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!
We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!
Participating is pretty simple:
If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.
For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!",

here
. We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we’ve published our
2015 transparency report
.
We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our
Privacy Policy
and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.
Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn’t easy as a small company as we don’t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.
In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.
In 2016, we’ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief
supporting Twitter
, detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.
In addition, we joined an amicus brief
supporting Apple
in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to
vacate the court order
compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy.
We are also excited to announce the launch of our
external law enforcement guidelines
. Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards.
We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d6li3o/an_update_on_content_manipulation_and_an_upcoming/,10952,1,An Update on Content Manipulation… And an Upcoming Report,"TL;DR:
Bad actors never sleep, and we are always evolving how we identify and mitigate them. But with the upcoming election, we know you want to see more. So we're committing to a quarterly report on content manipulation and account security, with the first to be shared in October. But first, we want to share context today on the history of content manipulation efforts and how we've evolved over the years to keep the site authentic.
A brief history
The concern of content manipulation on Reddit is as old as Reddit itself. Before there were subreddits (circa 2005), everyone saw the same content and we were primarily concerned with spam and vote manipulation. As we grew in scale and introduced subreddits, we had to become more sophisticated in our detection and mitigation of these issues. The creation of subreddits also created new threats, with “brigading” becoming a more common occurrence (even if rarely defined). Today, we are not only dealing with growth hackers, bots, and your typical shitheadery, but we have to worry about more advanced threats, such as state actors interested in interfering with elections and inflaming social divisions. This represents an evolution in content manipulation, not only on Reddit, but across the internet. These advanced adversaries have resources far larger than a typical spammer. However, as with early days at Reddit, we are committed to combating this threat, while better empowering users and moderators to minimize exposure to inauthentic or manipulated content.
What we’ve done
Our strategy has been to focus on fundamentals and double down on things that have protected our platform in the past (including the
2016 election
). Influence campaigns represent an evolution in content manipulation, not something fundamentally new. This means that these campaigns are built on top of some of the same tactics as historical manipulators (certainly with their own flavor). Namely, compromised accounts, vote manipulation, and inauthentic community engagement. This is why we have hardened our protections against these types of issues on the site.
Compromised accounts
This year alone, we have taken preventative actions on over 10.6M accounts with compromised login credentials (
check yo’ self
), or accounts that have been hit by bots attempting to breach them. This is important because compromised accounts can be used to gain immediate credibility on the site, and to quickly scale up a content attack on the site (yes, even that throwaway account with password = Password! is a potential threat!).
Vote Manipulation
The purpose of our anti-cheating rules is to make it difficult for a person to unduly impact the votes on a particular piece of content. These rules, along with user downvotes (because you know bad content when you see it), are some of the most powerful protections we have to ensure that misinformation and low quality content doesn’t get much traction on Reddit. We have strengthened these protections (in ways we can’t fully share without giving away the secret sauce). As a result, we have reduced the visibility of vote manipulated content by 20% over the last 12 months.
Content Manipulation
Content manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, etc. We have completely overhauled how we handle these issues, including a stronger focus on proactive detection, and machine learning to help surface clusters of bad accounts. With our newer methods, we can make improvements in detection more quickly and ensure that we are more complete in taking down all accounts that are connected to any attempt. We removed over 900% more policy violating content in the first half of 2019 than the same period in 2018, and 99% of that was before it was reported by users.
User Empowerment
Outside of admin-level detection and mitigation, we recognize that a large part of what has kept the content on Reddit authentic is the users and moderators. In our
2017 transparency report
we highlighted the relatively small impact that Russian trolls had on the site. 71% of the trolls had 0 karma or less! This is a direct consequence of you all, and we want to continue to empower you to play a strong role in the Reddit ecosystem. We are investing in a safety product team that will build improved safety (user and content) features on the site. We are still staffing this up, but we hope to deliver new features soon (including Crowd Control, which we are in the process of refining thanks to the good feedback from our alpha testers). These features will start to provide users and moderators better information and control over the type of content that is seen.
What’s next
The next component of this battle is the collaborative aspect. As a consequence of the large resources available to state-backed adversaries and their nefarious goals, it is important to recognize that this fight is not one that Reddit faces alone. In combating these advanced adversaries, we will collaborate with other players in this space, including law enforcement, and other platforms. By working with these groups, we can better investigate threats as they occur  on Reddit.
Our commitment
These adversaries are more advanced than previous ones, but we are committed to ensuring that Reddit content is free from manipulation. At times, some of our efforts may seem heavy handed (forcing password resets), and other times they may be more opaque, but know that behind the scenes we are working hard on these problems. In order to provide additional transparency around our actions, we will publish a narrow scope security-report each quarter. This will focus on actions surrounding content manipulation and account security (note, it will not include any of the information on legal requests and day-to-day content policy removals, as these will continue to be released annually in our
Transparency Report
). We will get our first one out in October. If there is specific information you’d like or questions you have, let us know in the comments below.

These are the primary metrics we track internally, and we thought you’d want to see them too. If there are alternative metrics that seem worth looking at as part of this report, we’re all ears.
Content Manipulation
Content manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, vote manipulation, etc. This year we have overhauled how we handle these issues, and this quarter was no different. We focused these efforts on:
Improving our detection models for accounts performing these actions
Making it harder for them to spin up new accounts
Recently, we also improved our enforcement measures against accounts taking part in
vote manipulation
(i.e. when people coordinate or otherwise cheat to increase or decrease the vote scores on Reddit). Over the last 6 months (and mostly during the last couple of months), we increased our actions against accounts participating in vote manipulation by about 30x. We sanctioned or warned around 22k accounts for this in the last 3 weeks of September alone.
Account Security
This quarter, we finished up a major effort to detect all accounts that had credentials matching historical 3rd party breaches. It's important to track breaches that happen on other sites or services because bad actors will use those same username/password combinations to break into your other accounts (on the basis that a percentage of people reuse passwords). You might have experienced some of our efforts if we forced you to reset your password as a precaution. We expect the number of protective account security actions to drop drastically going forward as we no longer have a large backlog of breach datasets to process. Hopefully we have reached a steady state, which should reduce some of the pain for users. We will continue to deal with new breach sets that come in, as well as accounts that are hit by bots attempting to gain access (please take a look at
this post
on how you can improve your account security).
Our Recent Investigations
We have a lot of investigations active at any given time (courtesy of your neighborhood t-shirt spammers and VPN peddlers), and while we can’t cover them all, we want to use this report to share the results of just some of that work.
Ban Evasion
This quarter, we dealt with a highly coordinated ban evasion ring from users of
r/opieandanthony
. This began after we banned the subreddit for targeted harassment of users, as well as repeated copyright infringement. The group would quickly pop up on both new and abandoned subreddits to continue the abuse. We also learned that they were coordinating on another platform and through dedicated websites to redirect users to the latest target of their harassment.
This situation was different from your run-of-the-mill
shitheadery
ban evasion because the group was both creating new subreddits
and
resurrecting inactive or unmoderated subreddits. We quickly adjusted our efforts to this behavior. We also reported their offending account to the other platform and they were quick to ban the account. We then contacted the hosts of the independent websites to report the abuse. This helped ensure that the sites are no longer able to redirect automatically to Reddit for abuse purposes. Ultimately, we banned 78 subreddits (5 of which existed prior to the attack), and suspended 2,382 accounts. The ban evading activity has largely ceased (you know...until they read this).
There are a few takeaways from this investigation worth pulling out:
Ban evaders (and others up to no good) often work across platforms, and so it’s important for those of us in the industry to also share information when we spot these types of coordinated campaigns.
The layered moderation on Reddit works: Moderators brought this to our attention and did some awesome initial investigating; our Community team was then able to communicate with mods and users to help surface suspicious behavior; our detection teams were able to quickly detect and stop the efforts of the ban evaders.
We have also been developing and testing new tools to address ban evasion recently. This was a good opportunity to test them in the wild, and they were incredibly effective at detecting and quickly actioning many of the accounts that were responsible for the ban evasion actions. We want to roll these tools out more broadly (expect a future post around this).
Reports of Suspected Manipulation
The protests in Hong Kong have been a growing concern worldwide, and as always, conversation on Reddit reflects this. It’s no surprise that we’ve seen Hong Kong-related communities grow immensely in recent months as a result. With this growth, we have received a number of user reports and comments asking if there is manipulation in these communities. We take the authenticity of conversation on Reddit incredibly seriously, and we want to address your concerns here.
First, we have not detected widespread manipulation in Hong Kong related subreddits nor seen any manipulation that affected those communities or their conversations in a meaningful way.
It's worth taking a step back to talk about what we look for in these situations. While we obviously can’t share all of our tactics for investigating these threats, there are some signals that users will be familiar with. When trying to understand if a community is facing widespread manipulation, we will look at foundational signals such as the presence of vote manipulation, mod ban rates (because mods know their community better than we do), spam content removals, and other signals that allow us to detect coordinated and scaled activities (
pause for dramatic effect
). If this doesn’t sound like the stuff of spy novels, it’s because it’s not. We continually talk about foundational safety metrics like vote manipulation, and spam removals because these are the same tools that advanced adversaries use (For more thoughts on this look
here
).
Second, let’s look at what other major platforms have reported on coordinated behavior targeting Hong Kong. Their investigations revealed attempts consisting primarily of very low quality propaganda. This is important when looking for similar efforts on Reddit. In healthier communities like
r/hongkong
, we simply don’t see a proliferation of this low-quality content (from users or adversaries). The story does change when looking at
r/sino
or
r/Hong_Kong
(note the mod overlap). In these subreddits, we see far more low quality and one-sided content. However, this is not against our rules, and indeed it is not even particularly unusual to see one-sided viewpoints in some geographically specific subreddits...What IS against the rules is coordinated action (state sponsored or otherwise). We have looked closely at these subreddits and we have found no indicators of widespread coordination. In other words, we do see this low quality content in these subreddits, but it seems to be happening in a genuine way.
If you see anything suspicious, please report it to us
here
. If it’s regarding potential coordinated efforts that aren't as well-suited to our regular report system, you can also use our separate investigations report flow by [emailing us](mailto:
investigations@reddit.zendesk.com
).
Final Thoughts
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the reports our peers have published during the past couple of months (or even today). Whenever these reports come out, we always do our own investigation. We have not found any similar attempts on our own platform this quarter. Part of this is a recognition that Reddit today is less international than these other platforms, with the majority of users being in the US, and other English speaking countries. Additionally, our layered moderation structure (user up/down-votes, community moderation, admin policy enforcement) makes Reddit a more challenging platform to manipulate in a scaled way (i.e. Reddit is hard). Finally, Reddit is simply not well suited to being an amplification platform, nor do we aim to be. This reach is ultimately what an adversary is looking for. We continue to monitor these efforts, and are committed to being transparent about anything that we do detect.
As I mentioned above, this is the first version of these reports. We would love to hear your thoughts on it, as well as any input on what type of information you would like to see in future reports.
I’ll stick around, along with
u/worstnerd

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3tlcil/we_are_updating_our_privacy_policy_effective_jan/,10669,2089,"We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)","In a little over a month we’ll be updating our
Privacy Policy
. We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.
Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.
The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).
One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.
In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for
Do Not Track
. Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.
Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable
third-party cookies
, and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related
extensions
.
We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.
Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/blev4z/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/,10229,1,How to keep your Reddit account safe,"Your account expresses your voice and your personality here on Reddit. To protect that voice, you need to protect your access to it and maintain its security. Not only do compromised accounts deprive you of your online identity, but they are often used for malicious behavior like vote manipulation, spam, fraud, or even just posting content to misrepresent the true owner. While we’re always developing ways to take faster action against compromised accounts, there are things you can do to be proactive about your account’s security.
What we do
to keep your account secure:
Actively look for suspicious signals
- We use tools that help us detect unusual behavior in accounts. We monitor trends and compare against known threats.
Check passwords against 3rd party breach datasets
- We check for username / password combinations in 3rd party breach sets.
Display your recent IP sessions for you to access
- You can check your
account activity
at any time to see your recent login IPs. Keep in mind that the geolocation of each login may not be exact and will only include events within the last 100 days. If you see something you don’t recognize, you should change your password immediately and ensure your email address is correct.
If we determine that your account is vulnerable to compromise (or has actually been compromised), we lock the account and force a password reset. If we can’t establish account ownership or the account has been used in a malicious manner that prevents it being returned to the original owner, the account may be permanently suspended and closed.
What you can do
to prevent this situation:
Use permanent emails
- We highly encourage users to link their accounts to accessible email addresses that you regularly check (you can add and update email addresses in your
user settings page
if you are using new reddit, otherwise you can do that from the
preferences page
in old reddit). This is also how you will receive any activities alerting you of suspicious activity on your account if you’re signed out. As a general rule of thumb, avoid using email addresses you don't have permanent ownership over like school or work addresses. Temporary email addresses that expire are a bad idea.
Verify your emails
- Verifying your email helps us confirm that there is a real person creating the account and that you have access to the email address given. If we determine that your account has been compromised, this is the only way we have to validate account ownership. Without this our only option will be to permanently close the account to prevent further misuse and access to the original owner’s data. There will be no appeals possible!
Check your profile occasionally to make sure your email address is current.
You can do this via the
preferences page on old reddit
or the
settings page in new reddit
. It’s easy to forget to update it when you change schools, service providers, or set up new accounts.
Use strong/unique passwords
- Use passwords that are complex and not used on any other site. We recommend using a password manager to help you generate and securely store passwords.
Add two factor authentication
- For an extra layer of security. If someone gets ahold of your username/password combo, they will not be able to log into your account without entering the verification code.
We know users want to protect their privacy and don’t always want to provide an email address to companies, so we don’t require it. However, there are certain account protections that require users establish ownership, which is why an email address is required for password reset requests. Forcing password resets on vulnerable accounts is one of many ways we try to secure potentially compromised accounts and prevent manipulation of our platform. Accounts flagged as compromised with a verified email receive a forced password reset notice, but accounts without one will be permanently closed. In the past, manual attempts to establish ownership on accounts with lost access rarely resulted in an account recovery. Because manual attempts are ineffective and time consuming for our operations teams and you, we won’t be doing them moving forward. You're welcome to use Reddit without an email address associated with your account, but do so with the understanding of the account protection limitation. You can visit your user settings page at anytime to add or verify an email address.",

Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause. That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them.
At the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family. The last few years have been pretty crazy and honestly, I'm looking forward to a Christmas free of work - but still encourage you all to continue to make the
reddit gift exchange
a ground breaking experience!!! It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now.
So what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.
Lucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When
/u/spez
asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of,
/u/krispykrackers
. Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community. A redditor since 2008, employed by reddit for five years, and a community manager for over a year, she has been a very important part of our daily community interactions and is so dedicated to her work that I'm not sure she even sleeps!
I'm very confident that krispy and spez, along with the rest of reddit, will guide the community to the best state it has ever been in and I am excited to see the future of reddit unfold with their leadership. 
Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!
Farewell, all!

creature-of-the-night
type of person? A straight-up vampire? Or just a redditor that wants to browse in night mode? Then you’ll be happy to hear: Night Mode has (finally) landed so you can read Reddit without searing your retinas (we heard it’s a thing).
We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit, and Night Mode has been a top feature request in the
r/redesign
community, so a few months ago we set out to build it.
...Annnnd now it’s been awhile since we first announced Night Mode was coming. Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough. But our design and engineering teams were undaunted: dive under the hood of the Design & Engineering effort to build Night Mode on the
blog
.
To start browsing Reddit in darkness, click on your username in the upper right hand corner, and then toggle it on. If you're on old Reddit, you can visit
http://new.reddit.com/
to try out Night Mode. If you enjoy it, you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode.
We hope you’ll enjoy this retina-saving feature as much as we do. But seriously jokes aside, we are continuously trying to improve Reddit for y'all and we'll post more soon. Let us know your thoughts on Night Mode.
Next week we’ll be providing an update about accessibility in the Redesign. While you wait,

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/,8797,1002,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),"Hello hello,
We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...
What’s New
New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds
Multireddits have been around a
long time
. They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.
More Support
We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.
iOS Screenshot
New Follow Functionality
You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.
Follow on new Reddit
Improved Sharing
We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.
Spaces
You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed.
Enough said.
Mix and Match
Follow a mix of communities and profiles.
Coming Soon
In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.
The Contest
We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the
gold
part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.
To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under.
It must be public.
Please only submit one feed per category.
Here are the categories that we will award winners from:
Aww
Artist Resources
Beauty
Books & Writing
Cool Pictures (images only)
Discussion (text only)
Fashion
Food & Cooking
Health & Fitness
Music
Parenting
Quirky
Sports
Travel
Wholesome
We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.
Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):
Some of my favorite communities

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/,8437,1791,Because it’s Valentine’s Day… here’s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!,"Hi All,
Two weeks ago, we
kicked off our blog series
to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.
Fun fact: When Reddit first launched, user-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.
Without further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.
Features inspired by the community
Image Flair - Emojis
Giving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like
r/baseball
's team logo flair and
r/WoW
's faction icons. To make this process simpler, we’re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.
Submit Validation
Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren’t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.
Flair Filtering
Many subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities.
r/personalfinance
uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting,
r/OutOfTheLoop
uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we’ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.
Sidebar
Many mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of
r/WholesomeMemes
to
r/IAmA
's schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes
text widgets
,
button widgets
,
image widgets
,
a calendar widget
,
a related communities widget
, and
a rules widget
. But we’re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.
Features inspired by 3rd-party tools
Communities themselves aren’t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES).
Toolbox:
Bulk Mod Actions
Moderating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You’ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.
RES:
Show All Images (aka Card View)
RES has enhanced Reddit’s expandos (i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs) for years, and one of the most popular features has been “show all images” (i.e., expand all the things!). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post’s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.
RES:
User Info Cards
(inline banning/muting)
When cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they’ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user’s stats (like account age and karma score) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio—plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.
Toolbox:
Removal Reasons
Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we’re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. (Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.)
Styling
Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community.
Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn’t work on mobile.
With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. (But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.)
With these new features, we're excited to say that
styling a community is much easier
. Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like
r/AskReddit
,
r/CasualConversation
,
r/Greenday
,
r/ITookAPicture
, and
r/NASCAR
. We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.
Join the Redesign!
Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in

Today, we’ll begin welcoming a small percentage of users into version 1 of our redesigned desktop site. We still have many improvements & features to ship in the coming weeks, but we’re proud of what we’ve built so far and excited to get it in the hands of more people. And if you don’t like it, you can opt out.
Our team has been hard at work redesigning our desktop site for more than a year. The main reasons
why we started this project in the first place
were to allow our engineers to build features faster and to make Reddit more welcoming. It has been a massive undertaking, but we started by
putting users and communities
first—building our designs based on feedback from moderators, longtime users, beta testers, and other redditors every step of the way.
What’s happening today?
Today, we’re beginning to give a small group of users access to the desktop redesign at random. We’re starting with a small group to test the load on our servers and plan to make the opt-in available to everyone in the coming weeks. On behalf of the team, thank you for all of your comments, posts, bug tests, conversations with our designers, creative ideas, and other feedback over the past year. We are very proud of what we have accomplished together and we are excited for you to get
your hands on it

Without further ado, and for those who don’t have access yet… here’s what the redesign looks like:

Classic
Compact
All that said, we know that many of you love Reddit
just the way it is
. If you are one of the lucky few chosen to test out the redesign and prefer the existing Reddit experience, you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top or visit
old.reddit.com
. Furthermore, we do not have plans to do away with the current site. We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit
we are looking at you i.reddit.com.
What’s next?
As those of you who’ve given us redesign feedback already know, Reddit can be extremely complex. That said, we have not yet rebuilt all of our current features. We’re still iterating on your feedback and building more of the features you love -- such as native nightmode and keyboard shortcuts --  plus more new features, which will arrive in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future. We’ve made
r/redesign
the community dedicated for feedback on the redesign, public to everyone and post weekly updates on our progress there.
We’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer questions.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/,7889,8673,Revamping the Quarantine Function,"While Reddit has had a
quarantine
function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.
On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the
Content Policy
, average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine.
The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.
Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s
Content Policy
and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.
Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal
here
. The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community.
You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process
here
.
This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it
here
and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ny59k/lets_talk_about_orlando/,7837,10004,Let's talk about Orlando,"Hi All,
What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let’s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.
I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.
The story broke on
r/news
, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.
Whether you agree with
r/news
’ policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.
We are working with
r/news
to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We–Reddit Inc, moderators, and users–all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.
In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:
Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts
: They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
We are working on a change to the
r/all
algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.
Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We’ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time.",

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8830oa/and_now_a_word_from_reddits_engineers/,7738,2760,And Now a Word from Reddit’s Engineers…,"Hi all,
As you may have heard, we’ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts,
u/Amg137
and
u/hueylewisandthesnoos
talked about
why we're redesigning
,
moderation in the redesign
,
our approach to design
, and
Reddit’s evolution
. Today, Reddit’s Engineering team invites you “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s core stack.
Spoiler: There’s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we’ll get through it together.
History and Journey
For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit’s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days—a
complete rewrite
from Lisp to Python in 2006, then
another
Python rewrite (aka “r2”) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that
u/spez
wrote about ten years ago.
Given Reddit’s historically tiny eng team (at one point it was literally just
u/spladug
), our code wasn’t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:
u/spladug
: ""For a while now, ‘The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist’ has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.”
u/KeyserSosa
: ""After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that (unsurprisingly) part of the code review process is to use ‘git blame’ to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file (one of the more core JS files we had). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‘full stack’ to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised (and depressed) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee (a senior web dev) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.""
u/ketralnis
: “I worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.”
Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown
a lot
since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team’s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you’ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements (like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons), and new features (like inline images in text posts and submit validation). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.
Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit’s desktop code to date.
Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags
Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages (Javascript on the client and Python on the server). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn’t want to outright break.
When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble—with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit’s 330 million monthly users.
But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase ""developer velocity,"" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more ""git blame"" for decade-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.
The New Tech Stack
These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:
React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type-related bugs, has good built-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. (You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in
this post
by
u/nr4madas.)
Just the Beginning
With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We’ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we’ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users (well,
a
mostly
steady number...
). So far, we’ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of ~20 features and 200+ bugs per month.
We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items (like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign—and because of our engineers’ work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.
Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish—we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn’t want to use it.
Thank you
to everyone who’s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.
PS:
We’re still hiring.

Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages
By default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.
Like this
.  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.
New Media Preferences
You can control how media previews display on your screen with
new preferences
available on your
preferences page
.
Media previews support more file types
We’ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.  Put simply, if you submit a link post to to Reddit with a URL that ends in
.jpg
,
.png
, etc., that media will be expandable.  Put even simply-er, more content on Reddit will have a preview available.
NSFW Flows
Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages, we’ve also added an
optional screen to block NSFW media
. This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media.
TL;DR:
Media previews auto-expand on comments pages
New user preferences to control media previews
More media previews!

transparency report
. In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the
content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons
, and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.
Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove
everything
: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than
this, surprised and censored Snoo
.
There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.
Today, this changes.
Effective immediately,
we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.
Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen
in its original state here
, featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.
Should we receive a
valid DMCA request
for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see
a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why
.
A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to
/r/ChillingEffects
, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.
You can view an example of a removed post and comment
here
.
We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.
Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.
Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You’ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We’re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.
What does it look like?
Check-out
u/Shitty_Watercolour
’s new profile page:
http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour
where he’s doing an AMA.
Reddit co-founder
u/kn0thing
is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood:
http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing
Riot Games is participating under
u/LeagueOfLegends
where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads:
http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends
On our mobile apps, you can search for “shitty_watercolour”, “kn0thing”, “leagueoflegends” and you’ll see them as
u/shitty_watercolour
,
u/kn0thing
,
u/leagueoflegends
(
example
)
What is it?
A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months
Who is this for?
We want to build this feature for all users but we’re starting with a small group of alpha testers.
How does it work?
You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g.
u/Shitty_Watercolour
,
u/kn0thing
,
u/LeagueOfLegends
).
If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our “friends” feature.
You can comment on their profile posts
Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community.
What’s next?
We’re taking feedback on this experience on
r/beta
and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit’s existing communities, which is why we’re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out.
We’ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below)
How do I participate?
If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this
survey
.
If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this
survey
.
TL;DR:
We’re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They’ll be able to post to their profile and you’ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in
r/beta
!
u/hidehidehidden
Q&A:
Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?
A: This is an early release (“alpha”) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.
Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?
A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer.
Q: When will this roll out to everyone?
A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we’re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.
Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?
A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There’s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that’s ok too.
Q: How will brands participate in this program?
A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.
We’re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in
r/LeagueOfLegends
and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.
Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?
A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere — therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can’t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the
r/beta
community as we grow and test this new product.
Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?
A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We’re also testing a new feature called “Active in these Communities” on the tester’s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.
Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?
A: This is one reason that we’re being so careful about how we’re testing this feature — we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in
r/beta
as the product develops and we onboard more users.
Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what’s the difference between the two?
A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.
Q: What about the existing “friends” feature?
A: We’re not making any changes to the existing “friends” feature or
r/friends
.
Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?
A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don’t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.
Q: I’m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you’re wrong?
A: We don’t have all of the answers right now and that’s why we’re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we’re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won’t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.
Q: How do I participate in this beta?
A:  We’ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We’re also taking direct applications via this
survey
or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this
survey

What started as 1 reddit community is now up to over 9,000 active communities that range from originals like
/r/programming
and
/r/science
to more niche communities like
/r/redditlaqueristas
and
/r/goats
. Nearly all of that has come from intrepid individuals who create and moderate this vast network of communities. I know, because I was reddit’s first ""community manager"" back when we had just one (
/r/reddit.com
) but you all have far outgrown those humble beginnings.
In creating hundreds of thousands of communities over this decade, you’ve learned a lot along the way, and we have, too; we’re rolling out improvements to help you create the next 9,000 active communities and beyond!
Check Out the First Mod Tutorial Today!
We’ve started a series of mod tutorials
, which will help anyone from experienced moderators to total neophytes learn how to most effectively use our tools (which we’re always improving) to moderate and grow the best community they can. Moderators can feel overwhelmed by the tasks involved in setting up and building a community. These tutorials should help reduce that learning curve, letting mods learn from those who have been there and done that.
New Team & New Hires
Jessica (
/u/5days
) has stepped up to lead the community team for all of reddit after managing the redditgifts community for 5 years. Lesley (
/u/weffey
) is coming over to build better tools to support our community managers who help all of our volunteer reddit moderators create great communities on reddit. We’re working through new policies to help you all create the most open and wide-reaching platform we can. We’re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We’re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community --
spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam
, not dealing with spam in your subreddit.
Protecting Your Digital Privacy
Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we’ve cared deeply about since reddit’s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address.
No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified.
As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015
.
We’re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.
We’ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report.
We made reddit to be the world’s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We’re learning together as we go, and today’s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond.
We’re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/aqzfl6/introducing_rredditsecurity/,5751,2,Introducing r/redditsecurity,"We wanted to take the opportunity to share a bit more about the improvements we have been making in our security practices and to provide some context for the actions that we have been taking (and will continue to take). As we have mentioned
in
different
places
, we have a team focused on the detection and investigation of content manipulation on Reddit. Content manipulation can take many forms, from traditional spam and upvote manipulation to more advanced, and harder to detect, foreign influence campaigns. It also includes nuanced forms of manipulation such as subreddit sabotage, where communities actively attempt to harm the experience of other Reddit users.
To increase transparency around how we’re tackling all these various threats, we’re rolling out a new subreddit for security and safety related announcements (
r/redditsecurity
). The idea with this subreddit is to start doing more frequent, lightweight posts to keep the community informed of the actions we are taking. We will be working on the appropriate cadence and level of detail, but the primary goal is to make sure the community always feels informed about relevant events.
Over the past 18 months, we have been building an operations team that partners human investigators with data scientists (also human…). The data scientists use advanced analytics to detect suspicious account behavior and vulnerable accounts. Our threat analysts work to understand trends both on and offsite, and to investigate the issues detected by the data scientists.
Last year, we also implemented a Reliable Reporter system, and we continue to expand that program’s scope. This includes working very closely with users who investigate suspicious behavior on a volunteer basis, and playing a more active role in communities that are focused on surfacing malicious accounts. Additionally, we have improved our working relationship with industry peers to catch issues that are likely to pop up across platforms. These efforts are taking place on top of the work being done by our users (
reports
and downvotes), moderators (doing a lot of the heavy lifting!), and internal admin work.
While our efforts have been driven by rooting out information operations, as a byproduct we have been able to do a better job detecting traditional issues like spam, vote manipulation, compromised accounts, etc. Since the beginning of July, we have taken some form of action on over 13M accounts. The vast majority of these actions are things like forcing password resets on accounts that were vulnerable to being taken over by attackers due to breaches outside of Reddit (please don’t reuse passwords,
check your email address
, and consider setting up
2FA
) and banning simple spam accounts. By improving our detection and mitigation of routine issues on the site, we make Reddit inherently more secure against more advanced content manipulation.
We know there is still a lot of work to be done, but we hope you’ve noticed the progress we have made thus far. Marrying data science, threat intelligence, and traditional operations has proven to be very helpful in our work to scalably detect issues on Reddit. We will continue to apply this model to a broader set of abuse issues on the site (and keep you informed with further posts). As always, if you see anything concerning, please feel free to report it to us at
investigations@reddit.zendesk.com

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/,5670,2773,Affiliate links on Reddit,"Hi everyone,
Today we’re launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won’t be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled “replace all affiliate links”.
The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We’ve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.
We’re structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it’s worth our time. It’s important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.
Thanks for your support.
Cheers,
u/starfishjenga
Some FAQs:
Will this work with my adblocker?
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.
Are the outgoing links HTTPS?
Yes.
Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.
Can I switch this off for my subreddit?
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.
Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?
Yes, this will be completed shortly.
This is available
here
EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?
When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.
EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?
If I post a link to
a storm trooper necklace
and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.
EDIT 3
We've added some questions about this feature to the
FAQ
EDIT 4
For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out
provided you have changed the user setting
. This will go live later today.
EDIT 5
The user preference has been added for
all
users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled ""replace affiliate links"" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.
EDIT (additional FAQ 3): Can I get an ELI5?
When you click on a link to some (~5k) online stores, Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase. If you don't like this, you can opt out via the user preference labeled ""replace affiliate links"".
EDIT (additional FAQ 4): The name of the user preference is confusing, can you change it?
Feedback taken, thanks. The preference will be changed to ""change links into Reddit affiliate links"". I'll update the text above when the change rolls out. Thanks!
EDIT (additional FAQ 5): What will happen to existing affiliate links?

Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
Hiring strong engineers like mad
Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)
These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a
long
time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.
Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely ""super highest priority"".
Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.
I have about 1.17 hours now to answer questions, and then I'm going and playing with my wee ones.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/,4129,5436,Reddit in 2016,"Hi All,
Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.
2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return,
Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography
.
Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a
number of improvements
to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.
Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.
I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.
We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.
This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.
As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/231hl7/we_recommend_that_you_change_your_reddit_password/,4099,3753,We recommend that you change your reddit password,"Greetings all,
As you may have heard, reddit quickly patched its SSL endpoints against server attack of the infamous heartbleed vulnerability. However, the heartbleed vulnerability has been around for quite some time, and up until it was publicly disclosed reddit's SSL endpoints were vulnerable.
Additionally, our application was found to have a client-side vulnerability to heartbleed which allowed memory to be leaked to external servers. We quickly addressed this after it was reported to us. Exploiting this vulnerability required the use of a specific API call on reddit, and we have analyzed our logs and found nothing to suggest that this API call was being exploited en masse. However, the vulnerability did exist.
Given these two circumstances, it is recommended that you
change your reddit password
as a precaution. Updating your password will log you out of all other reddit.com sessions. We also recommend that you make use of a unique,
strong
password on any site you use. The most common way accounts on reddit get broken into is by attackers exploiting
password reuse
.
It is also strongly recommended, though not required, that you set an email address on your reddit account. If you were to ever forget your password, we cannot contact you to reset it if we don't have your email address. We do not sell or otherwise make your email address available to third-parties, as indicated in our
privacy policy
.
Stay safe out there.

Edit:
A few people indicated that they had changed their passwords recently and wanted to know if they're now safe.  We addressed the server issue hours after it was disclosed on April 7th. The client-side leak was disclosed and addressed on April 9th. Our old certs were revoked by the 9th (all dates in PDT). If you have changed your password since April 9th, you're AOK.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/,3999,17998,Content Policy Update,"Today we are releasing an update to our
Content Policy
. Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.
Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.
Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.
Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.
I believe these policies strike the right balance.
update: I know some of you are upset because we banned
anything
today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3576g2/bringing_back_the_redditcom_beta_program/,3983,897,Bringing back the reddit.com beta program,"We're happy to announce that we're
bringing back
the reddit.com beta testing program. Anyone on reddit can opt-in to become a beta tester, and receive early access to reddit.com features before we launch them to everyone.
We'll be using
/r/beta
as the community hub for the beta program, where we'll announce new beta features and give beta testers space to provide feedback.
There are two ways to participate in the beta program:
If you're
logged in
to your reddit account, you can opt-in as a beta tester in your
preferences
, under ""beta options"". This will automatically subscribe you to
/r/beta
, so that you'll receive the latest information about new beta features.
If you're
logged out
, you can visit
beta.reddit.com
to see beta features. Note: you may end up back on
www.reddit.com
if you click on a link to reddit from somewhere else, like email or Twitter.
More details on the beta program, including how to give feedback on beta features, are on
this wiki page
. Please note that not every feature will go to beta before launching - some changes may not need extensive beta testing, and we will continue to release some new features to
reddit gold
members first. The best way to find out what's currently in beta testing is to check out
/r/beta
.
We hope our beta testers will be able to find issues and give feedback on new features before we launch them to everyone, so that we can continue to improve the quality of reddit.com for everyone.",

of new users. And now, as we get ready to turn the calendar to September,
we're starting to see the first signs of this annual phenomenon in our
traffic logs.
In past times like this, posts have popped up where the old farts formally
introduce themselves to the newcomers and get a good back-and-forth
going. This way, the latter can ask questions about the site and the former
can detail the precise way they'd like those darn kids to stay off their
lawn.
It's been a while since there's been one of these, so we thought we'd kick
one off today.
Some ideas to get everyone started:
What makes reddit special?
What are some cool aspects of the site that might not be immediately obvious to new users? Which of the default settings should be changed ASAP?
What are your favorite reddit communities?
What about reddit do you find ugly or annoying or buggy? Do you have workarounds? Perhaps a GreaseMonkey script or Stylish module?
